Crude but effective tool to unwrap Princess Maker 2 (DOS ver.) script files into "readable" form.

`usage: pm2txtu.exe script.txt`

It overwrites the source so be careful. You're supposed to extract proper files from .lbx archives
yourself. Also to get a proper ascii you need to find out what was used to edit those files or just
batch replace `0x0C` with `0x0D,0x0A` :)
